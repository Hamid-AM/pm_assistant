# Product Context: Kapsul

## What is Kapsul?

Kapsul is a location-based social audio platform. Users can record short audio messages ("kapsules") and drop them at physical locations around the world. These audio clips can only be discovered and played when another user is physically near that location, creating a unique and contextual storytelling experience.

## Key Features

- **Geo-locked Audio:** Voice messages can only be accessed within a geographic radius (e.g., 50m).
- **Time Capsules:** Optional feature to make kapsules playable only after a certain date/time.
- **Audio Feed:** A map-based or augmented-reality interface showing nearby kapsules.
- **Privacy Modes:** Users can choose to publish publicly, for friends, or anonymously.
- **Reactions:** Emojis or short replies that can only be added in proximity.

- **Creative storytellers and audio artists**
- **Memory leavers (e.g., couples, friends)**
