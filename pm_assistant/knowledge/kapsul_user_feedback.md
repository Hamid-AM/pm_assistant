“I tried Kapsul in Paris but didn’t find any audio near me. I think a heatmap of active areas would help.”

“It’s a cool idea, but I felt confused. Should I be telling a story or leaving a note? Maybe some examples would help.”

“Can you make it work indoors too? I tried at a mall and it didn’t load anything.”

“I love the idea of audio memories, but I want to share one just with my partner. Can we get private kapsules?”

“It would be awesome if you could schedule a kapsule to open next year at this same spot.”

“It took too long to load the map on 4G. Maybe cache kapsules locally?”

“Found one kapsule in a park, it was beautiful. Would love if I could save my favorites or revisit them later.”

“This is like Pokémon Go but for memories. Super nostalgic — keep going!”
